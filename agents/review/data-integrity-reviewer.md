   ```python
   # Before
   def process_payment():
       charge_card()
       update_order()  # Fails here = inconsistent state!

   # After
   def process_payment():
       with transaction.atomic():
           charge_card()
           update_order()
   ```

### 🟡 P2 Important

   - 💡 Fix: Add pessimistic locking or optimistic retry
```
